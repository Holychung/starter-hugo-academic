Hi! I'm currently a research assistant at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), and I lead a research team of 20+ graduation students.
Besides, I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from NCTU. My undergraduate project was about SDN at D-Link NCTU Joint Research Center. 

Also, I worked as an intern at 3drens Startup Company and Trend Micro Inc., a multinational cybersecurity company.
