Hi! I'm a Master’s student at New York University (NYU) and a former SDE intern at Amazon.

At Amazon, I was part of the Datapath infra team, and designed an overall architecture that integrates an internal service with a non-blocking network I/O system, and authenticated by an OAuth-based solution.

<!-- During my undergraduate years, I participated an open source project as a frontend lead and achieved a 95%+ (5000+) usage of NCTU students, obtaining annual funds from Alumni Association -->

These years I also had internship at [Trend Micro Inc.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html), [D-Link Inc.](https://us.dlink.com/en/consumer), and 3drens, and my priority is to employ microservice architecture with Kubernetes to construct reliable and flexible service.
