I am currently a research assistant at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and lead a research team of 20+ graduation students, developing the software architecture for sports learning, training, and video replay.

Besides, I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from NCTU. My undergraduate project was developing SDN-IP application on ONOS at D-Link NCTU Joint Research Center. 

Previously, I worked as an IoT front-end intern at [3drens](http://www.3drens.com/) Startup Company and testing intern at [Trend Micro Inc](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html).
